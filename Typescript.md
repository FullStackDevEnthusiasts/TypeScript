Certainly! Here are 20 commonly asked TypeScript interview questions with their answers:

1. **What is TypeScript?**
   TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It adds optional static typing, interfaces, classes, and other features to JavaScript, enhancing its scalability and maintainability.

2. **What are the key features of TypeScript?**
   TypeScript's key features include static typing, interfaces, classes, generics, union and intersection types, modules, decorators, and type inference. These features help developers catch errors early and improve code quality.

3. **How do you define variables in TypeScript?**
   Variables in TypeScript are defined using `let`, `const`, or `var` keywords, similar to JavaScript. TypeScript supports various types such as `number`, `string`, `boolean`, arrays, tuples, enums, `any`, `void`, `null`, `undefined`, `never`, and object.

4. **What are interfaces in TypeScript?**
   Interfaces in TypeScript are used to define contracts for objects. They specify the structure an object must adhere to, including properties and methods. Interfaces facilitate type-checking and enhance code maintainability.

5. **Explain the difference between `interface` and `type` in TypeScript.**
   Both `interface` and `type` can define object shapes. `interface` is traditionally used for defining object structures and contracts, while `type` can define more complex types, including union types, intersection types, and mapped types.

6. **How does TypeScript support static typing?**
   TypeScript enables static typing by allowing developers to specify types for variables, function parameters, return values, and more. This helps catch type-related errors during development and enhances code reliability.

7. **What are generics in TypeScript and how are they used?**
   Generics in TypeScript allow types to be parameterized when defining functions, interfaces, and classes. They enable writing reusable code that works with a variety of types while maintaining type safety.

8. **How do you handle optional properties in TypeScript?**
   Optional properties in TypeScript are denoted by appending `?` to the property name in an interface or type. This allows properties to be present or `undefined`, giving flexibility in object structures.

9. **What are access modifiers available in TypeScript?**
   TypeScript supports access modifiers `public`, `private`, and `protected` to control the visibility and accessibility of class members. `public` allows access from anywhere, `private` restricts access to the class itself, and `protected` allows access within the class and its subclasses.

10. **How does TypeScript support modules? What are namespaces?**
    TypeScript supports modules to organize code into reusable components and manage dependencies. Namespaces are TypeScript's way of organizing code into logical groups, preventing name collisions across modules.

11. **Explain the concept of type assertion in TypeScript.**
    Type assertion in TypeScript is a way to tell the compiler about the type of a variable when the developer knows more about its type than TypeScript can infer. It is typically used when converting one type to another, ensuring type compatibility.

12. **What are union types and intersection types in TypeScript?**
    Union types allow a variable to have multiple types, denoted by `|`. Intersection types combine multiple types into one, denoted by `&`. Union types provide flexibility in accepting different types, while intersection types combine properties from multiple types.

13. **How do you define classes in TypeScript?**
    Classes in TypeScript are defined using the `class` keyword, similar to JavaScript. They can include constructors, properties, and methods, providing a blueprint for creating objects with defined behaviors and data.

14. **Explain the use of namespaces in TypeScript.**
    Namespaces in TypeScript provide a way to organize code by encapsulating variables, functions, interfaces, and classes into a named scope. They help prevent naming conflicts and improve code modularity.

15. **What are decorators in TypeScript and how do you use them?**
    Decorators in TypeScript are a special kind of declaration that can be attached to classes, methods, accessors, properties, or parameters to modify their behavior or add metadata. They are extensively used in frameworks like Angular for features like dependency injection and routing.

16. **How does TypeScript support asynchronous programming?**
    TypeScript supports asynchronous programming using `async` and `await` keywords, which simplify working with Promises. `async` marks a function as asynchronous, allowing the use of `await` to pause execution until a Promise settles.

17. **What is a tuple in TypeScript and how is it different from an array?**
    A tuple in TypeScript is an array-like structure where each element can have a different type, specified at declaration. Tuples have fixed lengths and types for each element, unlike arrays where elements are typically of the same type.

18. **How do you configure TypeScript compilation and what is `tsconfig.json`?**
    TypeScript compilation is configured using a `tsconfig.json` file, which specifies compiler options, file inclusion/exclusion, and project settings. It allows developers to customize how TypeScript compiles their code based on project requirements.

19. **Explain the `never` type in TypeScript and where it is used.**
    The `never` type in TypeScript represents values that never occur, such as functions that never return or variables under impossible conditions. It is used to denote endpoints in functions that always throw errors or never complete.

20. **How can TypeScript be integrated with popular JavaScript frameworks like Angular or React?**
    TypeScript integrates seamlessly with frameworks like Angular and React, offering enhanced type checking, autocompletion, and error detection during development. Both frameworks have dedicated TypeScript support and encourage its use for scalable and maintainable applications.

Certainly! Here are another 20 commonly asked TypeScript interview questions with their answers:

21. **What are type guards in TypeScript?**
    Type guards in TypeScript are expressions that check the type of a variable at runtime and narrow its type within a conditional block. They help ensure type safety when working with union types or unknown values.

22. **Explain type inference in TypeScript.**
    Type inference in TypeScript is the ability of the compiler to automatically determine the type of a variable based on its initialization value. It allows developers to write cleaner code without explicitly specifying types in every declaration.

23. **What are ambient declarations in TypeScript?**
    Ambient declarations in TypeScript are used to describe the shape of objects and types that exist in external JavaScript libraries or environments. They provide type information for existing JavaScript code without rewriting it in TypeScript.

24. **How does TypeScript handle module resolution?**
    TypeScript uses module resolution strategies to locate and load modules used in a project. It supports multiple module formats (CommonJS, AMD, ES6) and provides flexibility in how modules are resolved and imported.

25. **What is a type alias in TypeScript?**
    A type alias in TypeScript allows developers to create a new name for a type. It is useful for simplifying complex type definitions, improving code readability, and promoting code reuse.

26. **Explain the concept of type narrowing in TypeScript.**
    Type narrowing in TypeScript refers to refining the type of a variable within a conditional block based on type guards or analysis of certain conditions. It allows developers to work with specific types within limited scopes, enhancing type safety.

27. **What is the `readonly` modifier in TypeScript?**
    The `readonly` modifier in TypeScript is used to make properties of an object immutable after their initialization. It ensures that once a property is assigned a value, it cannot be changed, improving code reliability and preventing unintended mutations.

28. **How does TypeScript support optional chaining?**
    Optional chaining in TypeScript allows developers to safely access properties and methods of an object without the risk of encountering `undefined` or `null`. It uses the `?.` operator to short-circuit evaluation if a property is nullish.

29. **What are type predicates in TypeScript?**
    Type predicates in TypeScript are assertions that return a boolean value and are used to narrow the type of a variable within a conditional block. They help refine types based on runtime checks, improving type safety.

30. **Explain the `as` keyword in TypeScript.**
    The `as` keyword in TypeScript is used for type assertion, allowing developers to manually override the type inference of the compiler. It is typically used when converting one type to another or when the compiler cannot infer the correct type.

31. **How does TypeScript handle enum types?**
    Enumerations (enums) in TypeScript allow developers to define a set of named constants, representing a finite set of possible values. Enums can be numeric or string-based, providing a readable and organized way to work with constants.

32. **What are type guards and how are they useful?**
    Type guards in TypeScript are conditional statements that check the type of a variable at runtime and narrow its type within a specific code block. They are useful for ensuring type safety when dealing with union types or unknown values.

33. **Explain the concept of type widening and narrowing in TypeScript.**
    Type widening in TypeScript occurs when TypeScript infers a broader type for a variable than originally declared. Type narrowing, on the other hand, occurs when TypeScript refines the type of a variable based on specific conditions or type guards.

34. **How do you handle null and undefined in TypeScript?**
    TypeScript provides strict null checks (`--strictNullChecks`) to prevent null and undefined from being assigned to variables unless explicitly allowed. Developers can use union types (`T | null | undefined`), type guards, or optional chaining to handle null and undefined values safely.

35. **What are mapped types in TypeScript?**
    Mapped types in TypeScript allow developers to create new types by transforming each property in an existing type according to a specified transformation template. They are useful for creating variations of existing types based on certain rules or conditions.

36. **Explain the concept of type coercion in TypeScript.**
    Type coercion in TypeScript refers to the automatic conversion of one data type to another. It can be explicit (using type assertions) or implicit (during operations like string concatenation or comparison), affecting how TypeScript treats values of different types.

37. **What is the `never` type and where is it used in TypeScript?**
    The `never` type in TypeScript represents values that never occur, such as functions that never return or variables under impossible conditions. It is used to denote endpoints in functions that always throw errors or never complete.

38. **How does TypeScript support ECMAScript standards?**
    TypeScript aligns closely with ECMAScript standards (JavaScript standards) and provides features and syntax that are compatible with ES3, ES5, ES6/ES2015, and later versions. It allows developers to use modern JavaScript features while targeting different ECMAScript versions.

39. **What are abstract classes in TypeScript?**
    Abstract classes in TypeScript are base classes that cannot be instantiated directly. They are designed to be inherited by other classes, which must implement their abstract methods. Abstract classes provide a blueprint for creating related objects with shared behaviors.

40. **How can you ensure type safety when using third-party JavaScript libraries in TypeScript?**
    When using third-party JavaScript libraries in TypeScript, developers can create ambient declarations (`*.d.ts` files) to describe the types and interfaces used by the library. Type definitions can be manually written or obtained from community-driven repositories like DefinitelyTyped to ensure type safety and proper integration.

41. **What are the differences between `interface` and `type` aliases in TypeScript?**
    - Interfaces are used for object shapes and contracts, often extending or implementing other interfaces.
    - Type aliases can represent any type, including primitive types, unions, intersections, and more complex types.
    - Interfaces support declaration merging, allowing multiple interface declarations to contribute to a single interface.

42. **How does TypeScript handle type checking for arrays?**
    TypeScript provides type annotations for arrays using syntax like `number[]` or `Array<number>` to denote arrays of specific types. It performs type inference based on array literals and ensures type compatibility during assignments and operations.

43. **Explain the role of `tsconfig.json` in a TypeScript project.**
    `tsconfig.json` is a configuration file used by the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) to specify compiler options, file inclusion/exclusion, project settings, and more. It allows developers to customize how TypeScript compiles their code based on project requirements.

44. **What are the differences between `null` and `undefined` in TypeScript?**
    - `null` represents an intentional absence of any object value.
    - `undefined` indicates that a variable has been declared but has not been assigned a value.
    - TypeScript's strict null checks (`--strictNullChecks`) help prevent unintended null or undefined values, improving code reliability.

45. **How do you handle type assertions in TypeScript? Provide an example.**
    Type assertions in TypeScript are used to tell the compiler about the type of a variable when the developer knows more about its type than TypeScript can infer. Example:
    ```typescript
    let someValue: any = "hello world";
    let strLength: number = (someValue as string).length;
    ```

46. **Explain the concept of conditional types in TypeScript.**
    Conditional types in TypeScript allow developers to define types that depend on a condition expressed as a type relationship (`extends` clause). They enable creating types that change based on the types that are passed in as type parameters.

47. **What is the `unknown` type in TypeScript and how is it different from `any`?**
    - `unknown` is a type-safe counterpart of `any`. Variables of type `unknown` require type assertions or type checks before they can be used.
    - `any` allows any type of value assignment and disables type checking, making it less type-safe compared to `unknown`.

48. **How does TypeScript handle function overloading?**
    Function overloading in TypeScript allows developers to define multiple function signatures for a single function name. TypeScript resolves which function to call based on the number and types of arguments passed at the call site.

49. **Explain the `readonly` array in TypeScript.**
    A `readonly` array in TypeScript is an array whose elements cannot be reassigned once initialized. It ensures that array elements remain unchanged after initialization, improving immutability and code predictability.

50. **What are namespaces in TypeScript and when would you use them?**
    Namespaces in TypeScript are used to organize code into logical groups and prevent naming collisions. They are particularly useful when working with large-scale applications or libraries that need to manage dependencies and encapsulate related functionality.

51. **How does TypeScript support mixins?**
    Mixins in TypeScript combine multiple classes into a single class to inherit their behaviors. They are implemented using intersection types and allow classes to inherit methods and properties from multiple sources, promoting code reuse.

52. **What are type guards and why are they important in TypeScript?**
    Type guards in TypeScript are conditional statements that check the type of a variable at runtime and narrow its type within a specific code block. They are important for ensuring type safety when working with union types, unknown values, or dynamically typed data.

53. **Explain the concept of decorators in TypeScript.**
    Decorators in TypeScript are a special kind of declaration that can be attached to classes, methods, accessors, properties, or parameters to modify their behavior or add metadata. They are extensively used in frameworks like Angular for features like dependency injection and routing.

54. **What are abstract methods and classes in TypeScript?**
    Abstract methods and classes in TypeScript are used to define blueprints for other classes to implement. Abstract methods do not have a body and must be implemented by derived classes, enforcing specific behaviors across related objects.

55. **How does TypeScript handle optional chaining and nullish coalescing?**
    Optional chaining (`?.`) in TypeScript allows developers to safely access properties and methods of an object without encountering errors if the object or its properties are `null` or `undefined`. Nullish coalescing (`??`) provides a way to handle `null` or `undefined` values by specifying a default value.

56. **What are the differences between `export default` and `export` in TypeScript?**
    - `export default` is used to export a single default export from a module, which can be imported without curly braces.
    - `export` is used to export named exports from a module, which must be imported using curly braces and their specific names.

57. **Explain the concept of namespace imports in TypeScript.**
    Namespace imports in TypeScript allow importing specific entities (like modules or objects) from a module into the current file's namespace. They help prevent naming collisions and organize imported entities within the current scope.

58. **How can TypeScript be integrated with React applications?**
    TypeScript can be integrated with React applications by configuring TypeScript (`tsconfig.json`), installing TypeScript types for React (`@types/react`), and writing components using TypeScript syntax. TypeScript provides type checking, autocomplete, and error detection for React components.

59. **What are the differences between `extends` and `implements` in TypeScript?**
    - `extends` is used in class inheritance to create a subclass that inherits properties and methods from a base class.
    - `implements` is used to implement interfaces in classes, ensuring that the class adheres to the structure defined by the interface.

60. **How does TypeScript handle type inference for function return types?**
    TypeScript infers function return types based on the types of return statements and the presence of `return` keywords in function bodies. Developers can explicitly specify function return types to enforce strict type checking and improve code clarity.
